# Hero
This project is for admission consideration into [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This project is intended to meet certain criteria and be fun. I that regard, there is one thing of note. In creating the concept I used a YouTube video from the bad lip reading channel. It is a funny music video regarding the attack of the rebel base on Hoth. Please be advised that there is a video in the project. It does help cement the concept, but is not required to meet the project criteria. I do not consider it vulgar or offensive, however, *any* video *may* be considered restrictive content for this project. Here is the concept.

## Intercepted Transmission
One of our deep space satellites has received a rogue transmission. It was grainy and a digital mess, but with the help of AI it is being pieced together. The transmission seems to come from a galaxy far far away and was picked up by star gazer as it rounded io, as it was in the dark, in orbit of Jupiter.

From what we can gather, an alien species that looks very similar to humans are engaged in conflict. This transmission seems to focus on one particular pilot who likes to rap when engaging the enemy.

This may all be concerning on it own, but what got our attention is, this seems to be the first know footage of the zombie outbreak. As suspected, this virus originated a long long time ago. If confirmed, this could be real hope.

This file is **top secret** and need to know only. It contains the cleaned footage of the battle as well as the specs for the pilot, tech, and planet where the incident occurred. This information is still fluid but we have been able to piece some information together.

## Site Specs and Information
I am running Node V18.18.2 with NPM V9.8.1. Site was set up with Vite@latest.

To run locally, fork then clone the repo. Run npm install from the root folder to ensure all packages are installed. This uses default Vite and is very lightweight. Run 
```npm run dev```
to start the Vite dev environment. The SWAPI api bring used is free and open source. No auth required.
